# Minesweeper
An implementation of Minesweeper made in early 2022 with the SFML library.

Most features of this minesweeper game are as expected. Mines are random, game is over when one clicks on a bomb or has cleared the spaces. Main differences are:

* Buttons that place mines in specific squares (for testing)
* The option to toggle between seeing mines and not seeing mines (for testing)
* Your first click can be a mine

Other than that, everything functions as a normal minesweeper game.
